        <h2>üìú Education </h2>

        <h4>
          15 September 2017 -> 15 September 2021
        </h4>

        <p>Degree in Computer Science at University of Granada</p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          In my phase of student of Degree in Computer Science, I developed
          many projects in different languages, such as: C++, C, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, and designed
          several web frontends using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap  
        </p>

        <h3>‚≠ê Python & Javascript</h3>
        <p>
          Using Python I have created many scripts, and developed some
          CRUD web applications. Moreover, Django was the main technology I used on my internship, where we built
          an ERP/CRM from scratch, with multiple functions. Using Javascript we build the frontend (VueJS). Besides, I
          have used Javascript to build a Server simulation, that I present on Sept 15th in order to finish my degree.

          Link to my final project: https://github.com/guillelpnz/TFG
        </p>

        <h3>‚úÖ Java & Ruby</h3>
        <p>
          I have a deep understanding of OOP, since I created a
          "Monopoly" game using Java and using Ruby. Moreover, I developed a paint/photoshop app , and a client-
          server app using Java.
        </p>

        <h3>‚úÖ C/C++</h3>
        <p>
          I have used C to parallelize code using OpenMP. C++ has let me create a game where
          a player competes with a machine trying to build words from an alphabet soup, as well as artificial
          intelligence based simulation, such as a 4 in a row game, or a simulation where an ant has to find food as
          fast as possible ignoring the map it moves on.
        </p>

        <h3>‚úÖ DevOps, Agile & Golang</h3>
        <p>
          My experience with DevOps was using Golang. I developed a text analyzer API, that would accept texts (ideally
          speeches), and analyze them in order to find repeated words and other analytics. The methodology I used
          was based on Agile Development, as I used Github with issues, user stories, milestones, pull requests, etc.
          Apart from that, I configured Docker to make my API more scalable, and used TDD to accomplish CI/CD,
          (TravisCI). The platform I deployed my project on was Heroku Cloud. This project can be found on: https://
          github.com/guillelpnz/TextAnalyzer
        </p>

        <h3>‚úÖ PHP</h3>
        <p>
          On a subject named Web Technologies, I developed a social website about recipes.
          People could CRUD recipes, comments, ratings and users.
